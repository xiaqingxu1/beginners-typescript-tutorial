# Example Markdown File with LaTeX

## Introduction

This document includes some examples of LaTeX used in Markdown.

## Inline LaTeX

You can include inline LaTeX by wrapping your LaTeX code with single dollar signs `$`. For example, the quadratic formula is written as $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

## Display LaTeX

For larger equations that you want to display on their own line, you can wrap your LaTeX code with double dollar signs `$$`. Here’s an example:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
$$

## More Examples

### Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It can be expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### Euler's Identity

Euler's identity is a famous equation in mathematics that shows a deep relationship between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

### Matrix

You can also include matrices in your LaTeX. For example, here’s a 2x2 matrix:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Conclusion

LaTeX is a powerful tool for including mathematical notation in your Markdown documents. It allows you to clearly and concisely present complex mathematical ideas.
